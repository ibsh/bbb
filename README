BBB (or Basic Blood Bowl) is a slight variation on the rules of Blood Bowl by Games Workshop.
It is intended to speed up the game and remove what I consider to be the more burdensome rules.
I wrote this just for my own league, but am publishing it in the hope it is useful.
I summarised the changes from LRB/BB2016 on the final page; that will be where most existing players will want to start, to see exactly how I have offended them.

Blood Bowl and all the associated intellectual property belong to Games Workshop, this is just a thing I did, I don't claim to own anything.
