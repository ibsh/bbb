BBB (or Basic Blood Bowl) is a slight variation on the rules of Blood Bowl by Games Workshop.
It is intended to speed up the game and remove what I consider to be the more burdensome rules.
I wrote this just for my own league, but am publishing it in the hope it is useful.

Blood Bowl and all the associated intellectual property belong to Games Workshop, this is just a thing I did, I don't claim to own anything.
